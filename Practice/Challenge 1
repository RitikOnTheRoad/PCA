🧠 PCA Challenge #1: Unscaled Features in Real-World Wellness Data
📌 Context – You're the Analyst
You’ve recently joined a health-tech startup as a Data Analyst Intern. The company builds personalized wellness plans by analyzing lifestyle metrics from fitness bands, diet apps, and health surveys. Your role includes discovering patterns in high-dimensional data and simplifying it for use in clustering, visualization, or prediction.

Your manager drops a task in your inbox:

📄 Problem Statement
“Hey Ritik, we’re trying to compress user wellness data into a few principal components to uncover hidden patterns in our customer base. Think of this like building compact 'wellness profiles'. I've pulled some raw lifestyle and health data — can you run PCA on it and give me a 2D projection we can later use for clustering?”

“Just a heads-up — it’s raw data from different trackers and forms. See what insights you can get and if anything seems off, fix it.”

🧾 Dataset Overview
You receive the following dataset with 200 customers. Each row represents a single individual, and the columns include metrics from fitness trackers and self-reported surveys:

Feature	Description
age	Age of the individual (18–80 years)
resting_heart_rate	Heart rate in beats per minute
cholesterol_mg_dl	Cholesterol level in mg/dL
weight_kg	Body weight in kilograms
height_cm	Height in centimeters
daily_steps	Number of steps taken per day
water_intake_liters	Average daily water intake in liters
alcohol_units_weekly	Alcohol consumption (units per week)
sleep_hours	Average sleep per night (in hours)
smoking_frequency	Average cigarettes per day (0 to 30 scale)

🎯 Your Tasks
Run PCA on the raw dataset as-is.

Generate the explained variance ratio plot.

Inspect the first few principal components.

Observe and answer:

Are the results meaningful?

Do certain features dominate the principal components?

Fix the issue (spoiler: the data isn’t scaled, so PCA is biased toward high-variance features like daily_steps and height_cm).

Scale the dataset appropriately.

Rerun PCA and interpret the corrected output.

(Optional) Visualize the data in the 2D principal component space. Do any natural clusters emerge?

🕵️ Hidden Insight
This challenge is designed to expose a common real-world mistake: applying PCA directly to unscaled, differently-measured features. This is your opportunity to spot, justify, and resolve a foundational data preprocessing flaw — a key skill for any analyst.
