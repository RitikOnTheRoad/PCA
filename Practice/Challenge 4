🧠 PCA Challenge #4: Reducing Redundancy in Clinical Diabetes Data
📌 Context – You’re the Analyst
You’ve recently joined a clinical research team as a Healthcare Data Analyst. The team is working with data collected from a long-term diabetes study involving female patients. The research lead drops a new task in your inbox:

📄 Problem Statement
“Hey Ritik — we’re trying to understand the underlying patterns in our diabetes dataset. The data contains various medical measurements such as glucose levels, blood pressure, insulin, BMI, and more. I suspect some of these features are redundant or highly correlated, which might be affecting our modeling efforts.”

“Can you use PCA to reduce dimensionality, visualize the patient space, and then attempt a classification of diabetes presence using the principal components? Also compare how well the model performs using the original features versus the reduced components.”

🧾 Dataset Overview
You receive a dataset with clinical information for 768 patients, each row representing a single individual. The columns are:

Feature	Description
Pregnancies	Number of pregnancies
Glucose	Plasma glucose concentration (mg/dL)
BloodPressure	Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
SkinThickness	Triceps skinfold thickness (mm)
Insulin	2-hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
BMI	Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
DiabetesPedigreeFunction	A function that scores likelihood of diabetes based on family history
Age	Age in years
Outcome	Class variable (0 = non-diabetic, 1 = diabetic)

🎯 Your Tasks
Perform EDA to understand distributions and relationships among features.

Standardize the data (excluding Outcome) and run PCA.

Examine the explained variance ratio to determine how many components to retain.

Interpret the top components using the feature loadings (eigenvectors).

Visualize the 2D projection of the data using the top principal components.

Build a logistic regression model using the top principal components to classify diabetic vs. non-diabetic patients.

Compare performance with a model trained on the original features.

Provide insights on redundancy, interpretability, and dimensionality reduction.

🕵️ Hidden Insight
This challenge mirrors the complexities of working with clinical health data — where variables often overlap in the information they contain. Your job is to uncover latent health patterns while preserving predictive power and interpretability.

✅ Deliverables
Scree plot and cumulative explained variance curve

PCA loadings matrix with interpretation

Logistic regression results (on original vs. PCA-reduced features)

Classification metrics (accuracy, confusion matrix, etc.)

Final report explaining your choices, findings, and recommendations
