# 🧠 PCA Mastery: Real-World Challenges & Project

Welcome to my **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** repository, where I practice PCA the right way — one challenge, one insight at a time. This repo includes **hand-crafted, real-world-inspired practice problems**, each designed to expose a common misconception or challenge in applying PCA to actual datasets.

## 🔍 Why This Repo?

Most tutorials show PCA on clean, textbook-perfect datasets. But in reality?

- Features aren't scaled.
- Some features are uncorrelated.
- Outliers mess things up.
- PCA fails silently if assumptions are violated.

This repo helps you **build real-world PCA intuition** by solving guided challenges that simulate the messy, unpredictable nature of actual data work.

## 💼 Your Role (in the Challenges)

You take on the role of a **Data Analyst at a startup**, where you’re tasked with dimensionality reduction to uncover hidden patterns in customer or operational data. Each challenge is like a mini case-study — a realistic situation where you’re expected to:

- Spot what’s going wrong
- Apply PCA thoughtfully
- Fix assumptions before analysis
- Interpret results meaningfully

## 📂 What's Inside?

### 🧩 `challenges/`

Each challenge includes:

- 📄 A realistic **problem statement** from your “manager”
- 📊 A **dataset** with real-world meaning (but synthetic)
- 🧠 A **hidden flaw** you must detect and correct
- ✅ A checklist of tasks and interpretations
- 📁 CSV files & optional starter notebooks

### 💼 `project/`

This folder (coming soon) will contain a full **real-world PCA use case** built using:
- All the skills learned in previous challenges
- A larger, messier dataset
- An end-to-end process: preprocessing → PCA → visualization → interpretation

---

## ✅ Completed Challenges

### Challenge 1: **Unscaled Features in Wellness Data**
- You receive raw health and lifestyle metrics for 200 customers.
- PCA gives misleading results due to inconsistent units (e.g., `daily_steps` vs `water_intake_liters`).
- Your job: **spot the issue**, **scale the data**, and **interpret results**.

---

## Challenges
- Challenge 1: Unscaled Features
- Challenge 2: Low correlation → PCA doesn't reduce much
- Challenge 3: High correlation → PCA does good.
- Challenge 4: Highly redundant features
- Challenge 5: Categorical data encoded improperly for PCA
- Real-World Project
